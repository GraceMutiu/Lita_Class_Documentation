### Project Overview
This project involves learning how to inspect, clean, explore, transform, analyse and visualise data to discover useful information, draw conclusion and help users make decisions. Excel, SQL, Powerbi were taught to know how to manipulate data, query large datasets and present the data through interactive dashboard.

### Data Sources
The data used for these classes were provided by the facilitators but i was encouraged to get data from online sources like kaggle to practise what was done in class.

### Tools and Techniques
- Microsoft Excel used for data cleaning, transformation, analysis and visualisation.
- SQL Server - Structured Query Language server for more complex data analysis and transformation on large datasets.
- Microsoft PowerBI for data visualisation.
- GitHub was introduced for portfolio building.
