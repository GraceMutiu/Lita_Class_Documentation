This is where I document my first project while learning Data Analysis with the Incubator Hub. This training covered the use of microsoft excel, SQL, and microsoft powerbi to analyse and visualise data.

### Project Overview
This project involves learning how to inspect, clean, explore, transform, analyse and visualise data to discover useful information, draw conclusion and help users make decisions. Excel, SQL, Powerbi were taught to know how to manipulate data, query large datasets and present the data through interactive dashboard.

### Data Sources
The data used for these classes were provided by the facilitators but i was encouraged to get data from online sources like kaggle to practise what was done in class.

### Tools and Techniques
- Microsoft Excel used for data cleaning, transformation, analysis and visualisation.
- SQL Server - Structured Query Language server for more complex data analysis and transformation on large datasets.
- Microsoft PowerBI for data visualisation.
- GitHub was introduced for portfolio building.

### Steps Taken
- Data cleaning: The data collected was cleaned by handling missing values, removing duplicates and reformatting columns for consistency. Pivot tables were also created to summarise the dataset.
- Data analysis: This involves manipulating the data to answer some questions and gain more information about the data. Analyis like generating the total, average, maximum, minimum etc were used. Multiple tables were also joined to derive meaningful insights.
```SQL
SELECT SUM(SALARY) AS TOTALSALARY FROM SALARY

SELECT AVG(SALARY) AS AVERAGESALARY FROM SALARY
```
- Data visualisation: The cleaned and analysed data were visualised using charts, graphs or tables.
